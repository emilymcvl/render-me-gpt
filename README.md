# render-me-gpt

GPT, but make it ✨pretty✨.

This repo contains JSON configs that tell your model how to **render like it has an art degree**.  
It’s not AI art — it’s **AI with taste**.

---

### what’s inside
- `chapters/` — color palettes for different moods  
- `templates/` — JSON base files for quick copy-paste use  
- `examples/` — renders so aesthetic they probably journal  

---

### usage
Feed the JSON to your GPT and watch it pretend to understand design.

```json
"mood": "ethereal but confident"
